# NAO Planning Challenge

### Group: Silk Sonic
### Members: Alessandro CalÃ²

### Windows implementation and new features
### CHiara Cippitelli and Benedetta Rogato

This is a study project for the Fundamentals of AI and Knowledge Representation course. The goal is to make a simulated NAO robot dance to a choreography that is generated by an algorithm of our creation.

## Files
moves      -> directory that contains all of the moves, custom and default <br>
main.py    -> main python file to run <br>
search.py  -> python file containing the algorithm

## Setting up the environment
This project is excecutable on Windows and Ubuntu.

To be able to excecute the project Python3 and Python2 must be installed. This project is tested on Python2 v. 2.7.14 and Python3 v. 3.7.0.

To download and extract naoqi, follow this [guide](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/dev/community_software.html#retrieving-software)


Windows:
in order to reproduce the song download also: ffmpeg (https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ (ffmpeg-git-full.7z )). To install it correctly, follow the guide: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows
